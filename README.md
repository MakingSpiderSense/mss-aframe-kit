# MSS A-Frame Kit

## Overview

**mss-aframe-kit** is a collection of A-Frame components built for my projects. I've decided to make it public in case anyone else finds these extras useful in their own A-Frame scenes. While others are free to use it, I don't plan on providing active support for this project at this time.

Each A-Frame component is maintained in its own folder under `src/components/`. Some components include their own README files with detailed documentation. Check the README.md file in each componentâ€™s folder for more information. The project includes both minified and unminified builds in the `dist/` folder.

Tested up to **A-Frame 1.6.0**.

## Features

Coming soon...

## Conflicts

If a custom component shares a name with one from `mss-aframe-kit` and it's not needed, it can be removed before registering the new one. For example:

```javascript
delete AFRAME.components["holdable"];
```

## License

You are free to use *mss-aframe-kit* in your own projects.
