# holdable

## Overview

The `holdable` component allows entities in A-Frame VR scenes to be picked up, held, and released using hand controllers with raycasters. It supports dynamic positioning and rotation offsets, automatic physics handling during grab and release, and custom collision shape preservation.

This component is ideal for VR scenes where users interact with objects, such as picking up tools, throwing props, or manipulating items in a puzzle or simulation.

_Tested with A-Frame 1.7.0_

## Basic Usage

Add the `holdable` component to an entity you'd like to make grabbable, such as a model or primitive geometry. Optionally provide local position and rotation offsets:

```html
<a-scene post-model-load-refresh>
    <!-- Holdable Entity: Basketball -->
    <a-entity gltf-model="#basketball" holdable></a-entity>

    <!-- Holdable Entity: Sword -->
    <a-entity gltf-model="#sword" holdable="position: 0 0.1 -0.1; rotation: 0 180 0"></a-entity>

    <!-- Controllers -->
    <a-entity id="rightHand" oculus-touch-controls="hand: right" raycaster="objects: .interactable"></a-entity>
    <a-entity id="leftHand" oculus-touch-controls="hand: left" raycaster="objects: .interactable"></a-entity>
</a-scene>
```

## Properties

| Parameter | Type | Description                                                                       | Default | Options                              |
| --------- | ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------ |
| position  | vec3 | Local offset position where the object should be held (relative to controller).   | `0 0 0` | Any position coordinates (in meters) |
| rotation  | vec3 | Local offset rotation applied when held (relative to controller).                 | `0 0 0` | Any rotation angles (in degrees)     |

**Note**: Left-hand interactions are mirrored - position and rotation offsets are automatically flipped when grabbing with the left hand.

## Behavior & Features

- **Raycaster Detection:** Object becomes interactable via raycaster when intersected.
- **Controller Grip:** On grip down, object attaches to the controller.
- **Physics Preservation:** Saves and restores original physics settings, including dynamic-body, ammo-body, and shape-based Cannon.js configurations.
- **Throw Velocity:** Upon release, a velocity is applied based on the controller's movement.
- **Rotation Center:** Rotates around the controller (pivot), not the object's center.
- **Grab Offsets:** Supports:
    - Per-object local grab offsets via `position` and `rotation`
    - Global default via `data-holdable-grab-position` set on `<a-scene>` (see below)
    - Fallback to automatically computed grab position/rotation if not specified (model does not move when grabbed)

## Additional Notes

- You don't need to manually add the intersection class (`.interactable`)â€”`holdable` adds it automatically.
- It's recommended to use the `post-model-load-refresh` component (part of `mss-aframe-kit`) if working with GLTF models to ensure raycasters and physics bodies are refreshed post-load.

## Limitations

- **No Two-Hand Support:** Only one controller can hold an object at a time.
- **Ammo.js Support is Broken:** Collisions do not behave correctly after releasing an object with Ammo.js physics enabled.
